Clever, Crafty, Content Profiling of Objects (c3po) is a software tool, which uses meta data extracted from
files of a digital collection as input to generate a profile of the content set. It is designed in a way so
that different meta data formats originating from different tools can be easily integrated. Currently it
supports FITS meta data and Apache TIKA meta data.

The tool follows a three part profiling process and provides facilities for data export and further
analysis of the content, such as helpful visualisations of the meta data characteristics, partitioning
of the collection into homogeneous sets based on any known characteristic. For each chosen partition of
the content, a special machine-readable profile can be generated that contains aggregations and
distributions for many of the properties. The profile optionally contains the set of chosen sample objects
that are representative.
